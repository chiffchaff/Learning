Grunt is a task-based command line build tool for JavaScript projects.

Grunt can auto-generate a grunt.js file—and some other project skeleton
material—with the init task, which can run without a grunt.js file in place

You need to choose a type of project to generate. Running grunt init will give
you a list of project types to choose from:

jquery: A jQuery plugin
node: A Node module
commonjs: A CommonJS module
gruntplugin: A Grunt plugin
gruntfile: A Gruntfile (grunt.js)

JSHint task -> it’s a really neat tool for checking your JavaScript code for errors. It can also be used to help enforce a style guide so that your code is easily readable to everyone working on a project.
