Modules
Node.js uses a module architecture to simplify the creation of complex
applications.

Modules are encapsulated pieces of code. The code within a module is mostly
private - meaning that the functions and variables defined within them are only
accessible from the inside of the module. You can, however, expose functions
and/or variables to be used outside of the module. To do so, use the exports
object and populate its properties and methods with the pieces of code that you
want to expose.
